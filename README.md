## ⚙️ Initial Setup

### Using Pre-installed Ollama

> **Note:** The external Ollama provider is disabled on macOS due to Gatekeeper restrictions that block local network requests. In the future, we plan to pay for an Apple subscription to sign and notarize the code.

If you already have external Ollama installed and running, select the **Ollama** provider in **API configuration** and manually specify the URL and model.

### Using Embedded Ollama

If Ollama was automatically downloaded when you first launched the application, select the **Embedded Ollama** provider in **API configuration** and download your desired model using the **manage models** button.

### RAG Configuration

To use RAG (intelligent document analysis), download an embedding model via **manage embedding models** in **RAG configuration** and adjust the RAG settings as needed.

## 🔒 Security and Confidentiality

Underlator is designed for working with sensitive data:

- ✅ **Local LLMs only** — all processing happens on your computer
- ✅ **Local storage** — all data is stored only on your device
- ✅ **No internet required** — the application works completely autonomously
- ✅ **No external requests** — your documents and messages never leave your computer

## 🗑️ Uninstall

Application data (chats, RAG vectors, and other files) is stored in the standard Electron userData directory:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Underlator/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Underlator/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Underlator\` (typically `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Underlator\`)

To completely remove the application, delete this directory after uninstalling the application itself.
